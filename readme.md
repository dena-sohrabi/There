- Add photos for people from X (Twitter), Telegram or pick locally
- Add any city without knowing the time zone
- Supports raw UTC offsets
- 0-1% idle CPU usage
- Ultra-low memory
- Written in Swift UI
- macOS 13+

## Roadmap

We want to keep the app as simple as possible. But here are the things we're considering for future versions:

- [ ] Widgets
- [ ] Time slider to view future/past times
- [ ] Auto-update
- [ ] Apple Script API for third-party integrations i.e. Raycast

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! For simple fixes or improvements feel free to open a PR with the smallest change.

For features or improvements that add scope to the app or have user facing changes, please open an issue first to discuss your proposal.

If you want to tackle any of the items in the roadmap section, please also open an issue.
